A utility tool to help you instantly, anytime.

## About
Tom is a curious developer. He wanted to contribute to a project on GitHub. He found X issues in a project. He then created an issue for the same. Phil, the project manager, is a very busy man with very less time to manage the issues page of the project. He viewed Tom's issue and wanted to give some reference to him about where he can start working on those issues. So, he used @Autolinks to help Tom.

_Autolink lets you instantly share web links related to a particular topic by just using keywords._

## Installation
* Go to the homepage of the app - https://github.com/apps/autolinks
* Click on the Configure button
* Add repositories or organizations to activate Autolinks

## Usage
_Autolinks_ currently works only for GitHub Issues. Extending it to PRs will be planned in future or if any developer is interested, he may work on this feature.

`@Autolinks <search_query> <number_of_results>`

Here,
* `<search_query>`(`str`): The term you want to be googled. (Cannot be empty)
* `<number_of_results>`(`int`): The number of results you want for a query. (Min:1, Max:9)

## Example
`@Autolinks Win 7 DLL file error 5` will return first `5` search results related to the topic `Win 7 DLL file error`.
